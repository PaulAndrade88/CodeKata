I've created this project following the instructions provided by email in .pdf format.

Here I'm using two patterns Factory method and Command, I think these are good selection for this application.

You may see some comments in the code, I leave those intentionally. So you can see what is the purpose of some lines of code,
most of them are related with the rules/constraints provided in the instructions.

You could see the solution separated in folders to better understanding.

With this project I had the opportunity to work with the patterns I mentionen above and also I learn how to use appsettings.json file
in a console app. Thats cool!. For this I needeed to create a class called InitialConfiguration, it is really simple I used this to 
allow the app find the .json file.

The program file, is also very simple, here i'm using the Requester class which is called the Invoker in the Command pattern
and here all the flow of the application starts.

After develop all the architecture and actions of the app I wanted to create a simple method(GetReport) which return the output
required.

I used the basic loops like "for" and "foreach" but also linq with the intention of apply most of the libraries or options we have with c#/.net
also as Enums and interfaces, I think those are common concepts but i wanted to mention it.

Oh! I leave there a class called car with the intention of showing another option to extend the functionality.
e.g. we could assign a People and Trip to a Car...


Well... Anything else you need from me please ask.
